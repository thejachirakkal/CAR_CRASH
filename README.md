The car crash dataset provides a detailed compilation of information related to common factors influencing road accidents, such as collision severity, weather conditions, road types, and contributing elements, offering valuable insights for the analysis and enhancement of overall road safety measures.

ABOUT THE FEATURES:

'Year' : The year in which the car crash occurred. 'Month' : The month in which the car crash occurred (numerical representation). 'Day' :The day of the month on which the car crash occurred. 'Weekend?' : A categorical variable indicating whether the day of the week is a weekend or a weekday. 'Hour' : The hour of the day when the car crash occurred. 'Collision Type : Describes the type of collision (e.g., 2-Car). 'Injury Type' : Describes the type of injury resulting from the crash (e.g., No injury/unknown, Non-incapacitating). 'Primary Factor' : The primary factor contributing to the car crash (e.g., FAILURE TO YIELD RIGHT OF WAY). 'Reported_Location' : The reported location where the car crash occurred. 'Latitude' : The latitude coordinate of the crash location. 'Longitude' : The longitude coordinate of the crash location.

CONCLUSIONS: Temporal Trends:

The dataset spans from 2003 to 2015, with notable variations in car crash counts over the years. The year 2003 has the highest count of car crashes, followed by 2008 and 2015. There is a general trend of fluctuating car crashes over time, suggesting potential factors influencing road safety. Monthly Distribution:

October has the highest number of car crashes, followed by September and November. The distribution across months shows potential seasonal patterns, with higher counts in autumn months (October, September, November). June and May have the lowest car crash counts. Daywise Analysis:

The distribution of car crashes across days indicates variations throughout the month. The 6th day of the month has the highest number of car crashes. Days 3, 5, and 4 also have relatively high counts. Weekday vs. Weekend:

The majority of car crashes occur on weekdays, with higher counts on weekdays compared to weekends. Weekdays may be associated with higher traffic volumes or regular activities contributing to increased car crashes. Hourly Analysis:

The time intervals 1600-1700, 1500-1600, and 1400-1500 have the highest counts, indicating increased car crash activity during these hours. Daytime hours (1000-1700) show higher counts, while late-night hours (2300-2400, 0-100) have lower or zero counts. Collision Types:

2-Car collisions are the most common, followed by 1-Car collisions and incidents involving three or more cars. Moped/Motorcycle collisions, bus collisions, and incidents involving pedestrians and cyclists are also recorded. Injury Types:

The majority of car crashes result in no reported injuries or injuries categorized as "unknown." Non-incapacitating injuries are relatively common, while incapacitating injuries and fatal injuries are less frequent. Primary Factors:

The dataset includes a diverse range of contributing factors, such as failure to yield right of way, following too closely, and other driver-related issues. There are 55 unique primary factors, with varying frequencies. Reported Locations:

The most frequently reported location for car crashes is "E 3RD ST," followed by "W 3RD ST" and other locations with varying frequencies. Some entries have empty string reported locations. Spatial Relationships:

There is a strong negative correlation between Latitude and Longitude, indicating a clear spatial relationship in the dataset.
